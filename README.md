Setup and Installation
Download the files: Make sure you have all the files from this project in a single folder on your computer.

Place your CV: Move your CV file, CV___Resume__Wakili (2).pdf, into the /public directory. The download link will not work otherwise.

Install Node.js: If you don't have it, download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command:

npm install

Development
To run the website on your local machine for development, use this command:

npm run dev

This will start a local server, and you can view your portfolio at http://localhost:5173 (the port may vary). The site will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

Building for Production
When you are ready to deploy your website, you need to create an optimized production build. Run this command:

npm run build

This will create a dist folder in your project directory. This folder contains all the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that you need to upload to your web host.

Deployment
You can deploy the contents of the dist folder to any static hosting service. Here are a few popular and easy-to-use options:

Netlify: Drag and drop the dist folder into the Netlify dashboard.

Vercel: Connect your GitHub repository and Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.

GitHub Pages: You can configure GitHub Pages to serve from the dist folder.

These services offer generous free tiers that are perfect for personal portfolios.
